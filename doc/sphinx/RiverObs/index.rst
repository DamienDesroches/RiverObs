RiverObs's documentation
====================================

The intent of the RiverObs package is to provide a set of Python
classes that enable associating data, remote sensing or *in situ*,
with rivers, as a whole, and with specific river locations. Although
the package was developed to support the generation of hydrology
observables from the NASA `SWOT <http://swot.jpl.nasa.gov>`__ mission,
it is quite general and can be used for muliple data sets including
point gauge data, irregularly distributed data, such as lidar point
clouds, or line data, such as GPS surveys.

Before taking a look at the detailed :ref:`API`, the novice user
should get familiar with the basic :ref:`Concepts`. The
:ref:`Overview` presents a brief description of the packages that form
part of the distribution, and their dependencies. The :ref:`Installation`
give detailed instructions on how to set up and build the
package. Finally, the :ref:`API` contains a detailed listing of all of
the packages, documentation, and links to the source code.
